Restaurants will play a key part in feeding people throughout the pandemic... On March 19th, the State of Nebraska directed restaurants and bars in Cass, Douglas, Sarpy, and Washington counties to close their dining / seating areas and move to takeout, carryout, or delivery only.  This action came after the Douglas County Public Health Department reported its second case of COVID19 that officials could not trace to its origin (commonly known as a community spread case).From the DHM, A gathering is defined as any event or convening that brings together more than ten (10) patrons, customers, or other invitees, excluding staff, in a single room or single space at the same time... Liquor, beer, and wine sales are restricted to carryout sales and delivery only, to the extent permitted by law. No onsite consumption is permitted. This includes bars, taverns, private clubs, regardless of name or characterization... Food and beverage sales at restaurants, bars, taverns, private clubs, and any dinein establishments are restricted to carryout, drivethru, and delivery only. This does not apply to and/or exempts food service in health care facilities... Lines of carryout and drivethrus in the abovereferenced establishments must have an environment where patrons and staff maintain social distancing (a distance of six feet away from other persons) whenever possible.Also per Executive Order 2006, ...restaurants and bars across Nebraska are closing their dining areas throughout the pandemic by altering their customary operations to provide takeout, delivery, curbside and drivethru service options.The Executive Order 1020 goes on to elaborate as follows, The provisions of Neb. Rev. Stat 53178.01 which prohibit the sale of alcohol to persons in a motor vehicle shall be suspended so that stores and restaurants can utilize drivethru windows or curbside to go pickup procedures.",required,NA,NA,NA,NA,2020-03-19,Strongly Implemented,Fully Closed,Required; Entire Population,Fully Closed (Required; Entire Population),Restaurant closures and limitations,Restaurant closures (excluding takeout/delivery),Restaurant closed,Restaurant closed,674_restaurant_closed.zip,https://www.dropbox.com/s/ov1cgx7ugok1m2z/674_restaurant_closed.zip?dl=1,Verified

The health status of all close contacts will be monitored closely. As a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient.

In addition, all other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.9.       Our public hospitals have put in place precautionary measures to screen and manage suspect and confirmed cases.

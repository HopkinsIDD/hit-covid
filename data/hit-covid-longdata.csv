Residents who tested positive were put in selfisolation at other healthcare facilities. Residents considered exposed but asymptomatic will also self quarantine at a separate healthcare facility. Staff who tested positive are self isolating. A number of neighboring healthcare facilities and hospitals are helping with his effort.
